# JSAssessment

Please note that I have 2 files for this project: <br />

1. game.js is the code that will read arrow keys as input to control the game. <br />
2. game-UDLR.js is the code that reads the letters U, D, L, R as input to control the game. <br />

### What did you like about this project? <br />

It was fun to try different ways to complete the project, and interesting to see the code run in the terminal instead of the usual webpage. <br />

### What did you struggle with in this project? <br />

It was quite hard to get the terminal to read arrow keys. The npm prompt only works with keyboard letter input, and arrow keys are not really an input. <br />
I needed to find the equivalent unicode of the arrow keys as well. <br />

### What would make your experience with this assessment better? <br />

My experience with this project was perfect! No need to improve on it :)
